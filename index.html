                    <span>T</span>he desire to be respected by someone of the opposite <br>sex is something that runs deep within everyone, even <br>though most people don't take the time to find someone <br>who truly respects them. It seems like people are just <br>looking for someone to show them the slightest amount of <br>attention, settling for something much less than respect. I <br>am convinced one of the best ways to help any relationship <br>grow is by showing respect. <br><br>
                    I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be <br>respected. What is respect? Respect is showing someone <br>extra special attention, or high regard, based on a desire to <br>show them how highly they are valued.
